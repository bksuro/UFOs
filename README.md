## Challenge Analysis



### Summary


#### Drawback of this webpage
The main drawback on this page is searching, we can only search on a whole match of the text entered, and wehn text is in lowercase, we cannot search on a partial match or mixed case text entry.

#### Additional recommendations for further development

  Drawbacks are the recommendations for future development
  - Add Partial text search using string contains function as opposed to '===' or '==' operators.
  - Add mixed case search by converting the text to all lowercase or uppercase.
